# 📚 Global Logger for React Native

## 🎯 Overview

This library provides a global logger for React Native applications. The logger enhances console output with colors and emojis, significantly improving readability and making debugging easier. It supports various types including primitive types, objects, promises, and errors.

## ⚙️ Installation

To use this library in your React Native project, just copy the logger code into your main JavaScript file (typically `App.js` or `index.js`).

Then, assign the logger function to the global object:

```javascript
import logger from 'react-native-prettify-logger';

global.logger = logger;
```

## 🚀 Usage

Once the logger is installed, you can call it from anywhere in your application using `global.logger(...)`. The logger can take any number of arguments and will log them out to the console. It also identifies and appropriately handles different types of values including promises, errors, and objects. 

```javascript
global.logger('Hello, world!', 123, { key: 'value' }, new Error('An error occurred!'), Promise.resolve('Promise result!'));
```
### Example 
```javascript
//dummy data to check the logger
const dummyData = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 25,
  isMarried: false,
  address: {
    street: '123 Street',
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'NY',
    zipCode: 10001,
  },
  hobbies: ['music', 'movies', 'sports'],
  job: {
    title: 'Frontend Developer',
    company: 'ABC Corp',
  },
  salary: 35000,
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log('Hello');
  },
  walk: () => {
    console.log('Walking...');
  },
  Error: new Error('This is an error'),
  Promise: Promise.resolve('Promise!'),
  undefined: undefined,
  null: null,
};

global.logger(dummyData);
```

### Features

- **String Logging**: Strings are logged with a green color and a 📄 emoji.
- **Number Logging**: Numbers are logged with a green color and a 🔢 emoji.
- **Boolean Logging**: Booleans are logged with a green color (for true) or orange (for false), and a ✅ emoji.
- **Object Logging**: Objects are pretty-printed with colored keys and values. Each key-value pair is logged on its own line. A 📦 emoji is used.
- **Array Logging**: Arrays are logged as objects, with indices as keys. A 📚 emoji is used.
- **Error Logging**: Errors are logged with a red color, along with the error message. A ❌ emoji is used.
- **Undefined Logging**: Undefined values are logged with a red color and a ❓ emoji.
- **Null Logging**: Null values are logged with a red color and a 🈳 emoji.
- **Function Logging**: Functions are logged with a green color and a 🔧 emoji.
- **Promise Logging**: Promises are logged with a green color if they resolve, or a red color if they reject. A 🤝 emoji is used.

### Customizing the Logger

The logger can be customized by modifying the `colors` and `emojis` objects in the code.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Configurable color schemes.
- Support for custom emojis and icons.
- Output to log files in addition to the console.
